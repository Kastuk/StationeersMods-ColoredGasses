Colored Gasses Mod For Stationeers

The white gas particles that show around when gas is moving now has colors, each gas has it's own color which you can set by pressing F6 and Clicking Advanced Setting, 
You can now see which gasses are in the room

The condensation now has colors as well but you need to enable this since it is off by default, when it on it seems like to much I need to fix it
